# JBefunge
Java Befunge-93

This application will execute Befunge programs.  See https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge for a description of the language as well as sample Befunge programs.

## To Execute

### Easy Method

1. If you are running on a Unix-like system (i.e. anything using `bash` or similar shell), you should be able to execute the `compile.sh`, `run.sh`, and `runTests.sh` scripts to compile, run, and run the tests, respectively.

### Compilation of Source and Tests

#### Details

1. Let's start by compiling the program itself.  `cd` to the `./src` subdirectory
2. Type the command `javac ./com/laboon/*.java`
3. This will have generated the class files in the appropriate directory.
4. `cd ..` to return to the root directory
5. Now compile the existing test suite.  `cd` to the `./test` subdirectory.
6. Type the command `javac -cp .:../src:./junit-4.12.jar:./mockito-core-1.10.19.jar:./hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:./objenesis-2.4.jar ./com/laboon/*.java`  Note that Windows users may have to replace colons (`:`) with semicolons (`;`).
7. Test classes and a test runner should now exist in the correct (`./com/laboon`) subdirectory.

### Execution of Source and Tests

1. From the ./src subdirectory, type `java com.laboon.JBefunge` to run the program.
2. Copy and paste (or type your own Befunge program!) in the uppermost textbox (the "Program Area").
3. Click the `Run` button to execute the program.  Note that if you have an infinite loop or other defect, you may have to kill the program from the command line (Ctrl-C on Linux, OS X or Windows).  The current stack will appear in the `Stack:` textbox and the output from the program in the `Output` textbox.
4. Now to execute tests.  Go to the `./test` subdirectory.
5. Type `java -cp .:../src:./junit-4.12.jar:./mockito-core-1.10.19.jar:./hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:./objenesis-2.4.jar com.laboon.TestRunner`.  This will execute the TestRunner.  When you first clone the repo, all tests should pass.

              ^                                 <
